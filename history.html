                <img class="img_deg1" src="images/santubong.jpg" width="250" height="170">
                    <p>Most people are probably more familiar with the mythology of Puteri Santubong than with its significance 
                        as one of Sarawak's two early civilization sites (the other being the world-renowned Niah Caves).</p>
                    <p>Once upon a time, there are two lovely princesses, Puteri Santubong and Puteri Sejinjang, they were 
                        dispatched to assist the residents of Pasir Kuning and Pasir Putih, who were experiencing difficulties.
                        Peace and prosperity reigned until one day, when a gorgeous prince named Putera Serapi entered the picture.
                        Both princesses fell deeply in love with him. As a result of their disagreements and fights, 
                        their father cursed them and transformed them into Mt Santubong and Mt Sejinjang, respectively.
                        So goes the folklore.</p>

                <h3>Folks tale about the origin of Santubong</h3>

                    <p>The Sarawak Malay Cultural Foundation (AKYBMS) Amanah Khairat General Manager, Datuk Dr Sanib Said, 
                        who is active in the research and study of Sarawak's history, stated that the history of Santubong originated in Kuala Santubong.
                        The establishment of a state in Kuala Santubong began with the adventures of Raden Adipati Sari - the king's son 
                        from the island of Java.The story of Datu Marapati's expedition begins in the Java Islands, 
                        and his majesty sails over the Great Ocean to Tanjung Datu in Teluk Gadur, eventually
                        establishing a royal kingdom in Kuala Santubong, also known as the state of Santubong.</p>

                    <p> After his marriage, the king and the queen sailed and finally reached Tanjung Datu, 
                        the king changed his name to Datu Marapati. A poem about Santubong state was written in 1885.
                        It is a very old manuscript, the history of the province of Santubong can be explained for,
                        this manuscript additionally clarifies the name of Marapati. </p>

                    <p>He stated that the spelling in this Jawi Malay manuscript is very obvious, with the characters mim, ra, pa, ta, and ya referring to 
                        "marapati" rather than "merpati" as it is popularly known in Sarawak.
                        After I examined this name based on my research in Sumatra, in Sanskrit, mara means danger and pati means King,
                        this is the meaning of the name "marapati," so his son was named Marapati Jipang, Jipang is a state on the island of Java.
                        This is the origin of the ruler of the state of Santubong, according to my investigation in the Malay community.</p>

                <h3>Another stories about the name of Santubong</h3>

                <img class="img_deg" src="images/pantai damai.jpg" width="250" height="170">

                <p>Mount Santubong, located just 35 kilometres from Kuching, is a paradise for nature enthusiasts as well as a historical treasure trove. 
                        The origins of this popular tourist location remain a mystery, with many legends adding to the mystique.
                        According to the Encyclopaedia of Iban Studies, the native Iban community, 
                        which has lived in this area since the seventh century, referred to it as "Si-antu-ubong," which means
                        "spirit boat" in the Iban language. This name is derived from the Iban tradition of burying the deceased 
                        in boat-shaped coffins made of a single hollow log, which were thought to transport them to the afterlife.</p>

                    <p>The naming of Santubong has a variety of origins, with some crediting it to the Hakka Chinese, 
                        who called it "San Chu Bong," which translates to wild boar king. Suhaili Kifli, 
                        chief of Kampung Santubong, told a local tradition, saying, " In accordance to history, 
                        some of the earliest people who lived here claimed that they saw a huge wild boar as big as a human.
                        " Interestingly, the name Santubong also means "collapse" in Iban.</p>
