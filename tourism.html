The park covers an area of about 4,100 hectares and is characterized by rugged terrain, dense rainforest, and numerous streams. 
    The main attraction of Gunung Gading National Park is the Rafflesia, a parasitic plant that can grow up to one meter in diameter and is famous for its foul-smelling odor. Visitors to the park can embark on guided treks led by park rangers to see these rare flowers in bloom, although timing can be unpredictable as Rafflesias bloom for only a few days. Apart from the Rafflesia, the park offers several hiking trails of varying difficulties, leading to scenic waterfalls such as the spectacular seven-tiered waterfall known as Waterfall No. 7.
     Gunung Gading National Park is also home to a diverse array of flora and fauna, including numerous bird species and other tropical plants, making it a popular destination for nature lovers and hiking enthusiasts.
